Version 2.0.9:
    Fix typo in configure script which prevents it from running.

Version 2.0.8:
    Bug fixes:
    - Fix build against glibc 2.16 and newer.

    Miscelaneous changes:
    - Added correct breaking for Unicode Regional Indicators.

Version 2.0.7:
    Fix incorrect release of 2.0.6, which omitted changes from the 2.0.5
    release.

Version 2.0.6
    Bug fixes:
    - Fix incorrect line numbering caused by optimized printing of differences
      preceeded in both files by whitespace containing newlines.

Version 2.0.5:
    Bug fixes:
    - fix a bug in the handling of context, which caused incorrect diffs to be
      printed. In some cases text was reported both as removed and as common.

Version 2.0.4:
    Bug fixes:
    - fix a memory allocation bug, which would be triggered by large values
      for the -m option.

Version 2.0.3:
    Updated translations for German (incomplete), French (incomplete) and
    Spanish.

Version 2.0.2:
    Bug fixes:
    - add support for DESTDIR in the Makefile install target.
    - fix build error on --without-unicode compiles.

Version 2.0.1:
    Bug fixes:
    - escape parsing for unknown escapes (like for example \;) would result
      in incorrect strings.
    - when the space character is not considered whitespace, dwdiff will no
      longer use it to make changes more readable.

    Internal changes:
    - the token file no longer uses a newline character as separator, but a nul
      character, making reparsing easier and the whole of dwdiff more robust.

Version 2.0:
    New features:
    - dwdiff is no longer a front-end for the diff program, but includes its
      own diff-algorithm implementation (taken from GNU diff). This makes
      dwdiff much faster, and ensures that results are the same across all
      platforms.

    Bug fixes:
    - when two additions are made with a single common token in between, dwdiff
      incorrectly reported the common token as replaced by the two additions
      and the common token.
    - when using the --diff-input option, in some cases dwdiff would report
      changes spanning multiple diff sections.

Version 1.9:
    New features:
    - an option for reading the output of diff (in Unified Diff) format was
      added (--diff-input) which can be used to reformat diffs for enhanced
      readability.

Version 1.8.2:
    New features:
    - when parsing options, \e is understood to mean the escape character

    Bug fixes:
    - the -p and -l options did not correctly handle UTF-8 characters.

Version 1.8.1:
    New features:
    - the context matching now decreases the matched context size exponentially,
      instead of immediately using the context-less mode if the changes found
      with context need refining. This results in more intuitive output when
      increasing the matching context size.

Version 1.8:
    New features:
    - added an option to repeat the begin and end markers at the start and end
      of line if a change crosses a newline

    Bug fixes:
    - newline characters in the delimiter set where handled incorrectly in
      UTF-8 mode

Version 1.7:
    New features:
    - added dwfilter program which reformats the old text such that it matches
      the new text to allow other programs such as visual diff tools to show
      the differences better. dwfilter can also be used to generate regular
      diffs to patch the old text by reformating the new text as the old text
      before executing diff [with caveats].

    Bug fixes:
    - \u and \U escapes were parsed incorrectly
    - dwdiff crashed when generating statistics for empty files

Version 1.6.1:
    Bug fixes:
    - the line clearing implemented for better background color handling caused
      (parts of) lines to disappear in the output with cr/nl line endings
    - the new paragraph separators were not handled correctly with the context
      matching feature, causing crashes

Version 1.6:
    New features:
    - the output for deleted text was changed such that the whitespace following
      the deletion is now the whitespace that followed the deleted text, rather
      than the whitespace that is now before the next word in the new file
    - the output for changed text was changed in the case that the whitespace
      before the old text contains a newline. In this case, depending on whether
      the whitespace before the new text contains a newline, the new file's
      whitespace is replaced by a single space or the new text is printed first
    - the --wdiff-output option was added to revert to the old output mode
    - the color specification now also allows specification of the background
      color and custom escape sequences
    - a new option to add markers for deleted or inserted blocks of lines
      containing only whitespace (paragraph separators)

    Bug fixes:
    - octal escapes are now properly parsed
    - icu-config was called directly rather than through $ICU_CONFIG in the
      configure script, which prevented proper operation of the --icu-config
      option
    - compilation on systems without nl_langinfo was fixed

Version 1.5.2
    New features:
    - better option parsing, which allows short options to be grouped. For
      example -iPc instead of -i -P -c

    Bug fixes:
    - compatibility fixes to configure script

Version 1.5.1:
    Bug fixes:
    - Statistics are now printed to stderr instead of stdout such that the only
      thing printed on stdout is the text
    - Repaired code for diff programs that do not support -a option
    - Fixed Makefile to pass settings for diff program to C compiler

Version 1.5:
    New features:
    - added match context which ensures better results for large edits with
      frequently occuring words

Version 1.4:
    New features:
    - an option to use all punctuation characters as delimiters
    - Unicode (UTF-8) support including formatting insensitive comparison
    - case-insensitive comparison when the underlying diff program does not
      support it

Version 1.3:
    New features:
    - an option to print the line numbers at which the text appears in the old
      and new file respectively
    - an option to print only a user specified number of context lines
      surrounding lines with changes

    Bug fixes:
    - added printing of color mark-up codes at the start of every new line to
      improve viewing the output with less
    - the check for overlap between the delimiter and the whitespace sets was
      incomplete and incorrect
    - an inverted condition caused incorrect output if the newline character
      was not part of the whitespace set

Version 1.2.1:
    Bug fixes:
    - fixed a bug in color mode where the resetting of a color would cause
      extra characters to be printed

Version 1.2:
    New features:
    - color mode, enabled by -c
    - internationalisation. dwdiff can now use gettext and includes translated
      manual pages. Languages included in the distribution are: en (default)
      and nl.

Version 1.1:
    Bug fixes:
    - fixes bug in \x-escape expansion of whitespace and delimiter lists

    New features:
    - will work on POSIX compatible diff, i.e. diff without -a and -i options
    - handles empty whitespace specification
    - allows nul character in whitespace and delimiter specification
    - \-escape expansion of start/stop-delete/insert markers
    - a single dash (-) can be specified as a file to read from standard input
    - a double dash (--) will stop dwdiff from interpreting arguments starting
      with a dash as options
    - allows the user to specify further options to the diff program to allow
      minimal diffs, half-hearted algorithms etc.
