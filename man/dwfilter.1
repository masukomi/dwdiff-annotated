.SH NAME
dwfilter \- reformat text with dwdiff for further processing
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdwfilter\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fIOLD FILE\fR \fINEW FILE\fR \fIPOST PROCESSOR\fR [\fIPOST PROCESSOR OPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdwfilter\fR reformats the text in the old file according to the contents of
the new file (or vice versa) and subsequently passes the reformated old file
and the new file through a secondary filter. It's main use is to allow visual
diff programs such as \fBmeld\fR and \fBkdiff3\fR to be used, eventhough a text
file has been reformated after editing. A further use is to allow the creation
of small patches even when the new text has been reformated. \fBdwfilter\fR
uses \fBdwdiff\fR for reformatting.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reverse\fR
Reformat the new file based on the contents of the old file instead of the
default where the old file is reformated based on the contents of the new file.
.PP
\fBdwfilter\fR accepts the following \fBdwdiff\fR options:

A single dash (\-) as a file can be used to denote standard input. Only one
file can be read from standard input. To stop \fBdwfilter\fR from interpreting
file names that start with a dash as options, one can specify a double dash
(\-\-) after which \fBdwfilter\fR will interpret any following arguments as files
to read.
